# NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a Javascript package manager and the default package manager for Node projects. NPM is installed when NodeJS is installed on a machine. It comes with a command-line interface (CLI) used to interact with the online database of NPM. This database is called the NPM Registry, and it hosts public and private 'packages.' To add or update packages, we use the NPM CLI to interact with this database. 

Isaac Z. Schlueter developed NPM purely in Javascript. It was first released in November 2010. Ever since, NPM has had a lot of updates and has improved in terms of efficiency, speed and security. 


# NPX stands for Node Package eXecute. It is simply an NPM package runner. It allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it. NPX is installed automatically with NPM version 5.2.0 and above.
